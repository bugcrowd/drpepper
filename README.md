Dr Pepper needs your help
=========================

Dr Pepper has asked for your help in designing their infrastructure. Dr Pepper would like to move their infrastructure off of their self hosted Toshiba tablets and into the cloud. But he doesn't have any idea where to start. You'll need to explain to him the what the buzz words mean and come with a solution for their new infrastructure.

Dr Pepper's grandson's gf's uncle built a monolithic PHP application with Sqlite and Riak database's. It works well but reliability has been a problem. Also Dr Pepper has heard of all the hackers out there who might be trying to hack his servers. This is a serious concern for Dr Pepper because their drink formula is top secret. If this formula was to be leaked; Dr Pepper's business would collapse.

Task 1
------

Design Dr Pepper's new infrastructure for AWS to be resilient to failure and highly secure. For the moment it is not feasible to redesign the application but he is open for suggestions for modifications once the initial migration is complete. Please explain to Dr Pepper in simple english terms what technology you will use. Dr Pepper's grandson's gf's uncle will also be reviewing the designs. He likes to go deep on the technical details.

Task 2
------

Dr Pepper has a hobby collecting stamps and has asked you to write a Bash script to process all known stamps from https://gist and upload the result to s3. He would like the stamps grouped by country and sorted by release date. He would also like to know how many stamps have been release for each county. Dr Pepper's grandson's gf's uncle mentioned something about `jq`.

Upload the result to s3://bucket/{first_name}-{last_name}.json with the credentials you have been granted.
